## 🚀 How to Play in GitHub  

### 🔹 Step 1: Fork & Clone the Repo  
- Each pair forks this repository and clones it locally.  

### 🔹 Step 2: Proposer Submits Offer  
- The proposer creates a new text file named **`yourname.txt`** (e.g., `alice.txt`).  
- Inside the file, they write:  

  ```txt
  I offer $X to my partner.
  ```
- They commit and push their file, then open a pull request.

### 🔹 Step 3: Responder Reviews the Offer
- The responder visits the PR and leaves a comment:
- Accept: “I accept this offer.”
- Reject: “I reject this offer.”
- If accepted, the responder merges the PR.
- If rejected, the responder closes the PR without merging.
